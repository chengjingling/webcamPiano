## About

This application is a motion-detected piano created using the p5.js library. It detects movement in the webcam footage which is used to activate notes on a grid, each column associated with a specific pitch from a pentatonic scale. The activated notes are played using the p5.js sound library, and visually represented as circles that change in colour and opacity over time. The sensitivity of the motion detection can be adjusted using the threshold slider, with a lower threshold being more sensitive and a higher threshold being less sensitive.
